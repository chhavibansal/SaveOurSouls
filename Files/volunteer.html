                <p>Our volunteers are the heart of our organization! We could not offer all the programs and services without our Volunteer Team!  … from dog walking & cat cuddling, helping with our mounds of laundry, making pet therapy visits, showcasing shelter animals off-site or baking cakes & cookies for events… we would be struggling without our wonderful group of volunteers!  Our many volunteer opportunities work well with every schedule and time constraint. Take a look at the volunteer opportunities.</p>
                <p style="clear: both;" >Join the Helping Paws team and become a Volunteer ‘Rock Star’! Volunteering is a rewarding experience for many and a great way to help our homeless animals and give them a “second chance”. As a mostly volunteer-based organization, Helping Paws is always in need of dedicated volunteers who want to make a difference. If you have a few hours each week or month to contribute your time and talents, then we would love to hear from you. Volunteers do many different kinds of things, including animal care (walking dogs, cleaning cat cages, etc.), assisting during fundraising events, doing data entry, and much more.

                Adult volunteer positions are for those ages 18 and older. Helping Paws is looking for volunteers who are willing to make a weekly or monthly commitment to help support the shelter and the animals. We also accept one-time/short-term groups, students and court-appointed community service volunteers. Please fill out the appropriate volunteer application that best fits your situation.</p>

                            <p>The most important attribute of a volunteer is commitment! We understand that people’s schedules may not always be consistent and that hours of availability may fluctuate, however, we need your commitment to selected programs for our relationship to be mutually beneficial.
                            <br><br> Volunteers participate in a number of different programs on our behalf and each follow varying timelines. However, in the case of our animal care volunteers, we do require a regular visit to the shelter. A weekly visit is ideal. We would also hope that you have applied with a long-term commitment to the animals in mind.

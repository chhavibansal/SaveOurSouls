            <ul>
                <li>Volunteer positions are available only to those individuals who are 18 years of age or older</li>
                <li>All volunteer need to complete an “application form” and a general interview.</li>
                <li>On the basis of our need and the extend of your desire to help we assign you your position. The voluntary program is of minimum 6 weeks. Since this is a people funded organisation we will pass on as many benefits to our volunteers as we can at ease.</li>

        <button class="accordion">What is expected of a volunteer?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The most important attribute of a volunteer is commitment! We understand that people’s schedules may not always be consistent and that hours of availability may fluctuate, however, we need your commitment to selected programs for our relationship to be mutually beneficial.
                <br><br> Volunteers participate in a number of different programs on our behalf and each follow varying timelines. However, in the case of our animal care volunteers, we do require a regular visit to the shelter. A weekly visit is ideal. We would also hope that you have applied with a long-term commitment to the animals in mind.

                <p>Dog walkers not only provide exercise, but teach dogs basic obedience commands with the goal of making their stay at the shelter more stimulating. Training also helps the dogs make an easier transition into their new homes.

                <br>Duties include: walking, socializing and comforting the dogs; using learned PAWS' training practices; monitoring behavior and medical needs on daily log; preparing and giving dog treats; assisting the public when they have questions; assisting with laundry and dishes; and scooping poop.</p>
